## 🎯 ABOUT ME: DEFENDING THE DIGITAL FRONTIER

I am a **Cybersecurity Graduate** from Indiana Institute of Technology with a proven track record in **incident response**, **network defense**, and **secure coding practices**. My journey in cybersecurity combines hands-on technical expertise with a passion for education and innovation, having mentored over 100 students while simultaneously contributing to real-world security operations at Humata.AI.

### 🔐 My Security Philosophy

In today's threat landscape, reactive security is no longer sufficient. I believe in building **proactive defense mechanisms** that anticipate threats before they materialize, combining traditional security frameworks (NIST, OWASP) with cutting-edge technologies like AI-powered threat detection and automated incident response systems.

### 💡 What Sets Me Apart

**Technical Depth Meets Communication Excellence**: Unlike many security professionals who excel in either technical execution or stakeholder communication, I bridge both worlds seamlessly. My experience as an Embedded Tutor and Teaching Assistant at Indiana Institute of Technology taught me to translate complex security concepts into actionable insights for diverse audiences—from computer science students to executive stakeholders.

**Hands-On Security Operations**: During my internship at **Humata.AI** (Summer 2023), I wasn't just resolving user tickets—I was actively **identifying platform vulnerabilities**, **ensuring GDPR/CCPA compliance**, and **collaborating with the security team** to implement mitigation strategies that improved system stability by 25%. I streamlined support processes using Slack, Stripe, and Intercom, reducing incident response time by 30% while maintaining meticulous attention to data privacy.

**Educational Impact**: For two consecutive academic years (2023-2025), I've guided students through the intricacies of **Python scripting for security automation**, **Linux security hardening**, and **cryptographic implementations**. My labs on network defense principles and secure coding practices resulted in measurable improvements—students consistently achieved 15-20% higher exam scores and demonstrated enhanced project quality through meticulous attention to security best practices.

**Research & Academic Contribution**: As a Research Assistant, I partnered with Professor Patricia Tanner to architect a comprehensive Master's degree program in cybersecurity. This involved conducting in-depth research on curriculum frameworks, analyzing peer institution programs, synthesizing accreditation requirements, and drafting course descriptions that aligned with both academic rigor and industry workforce needs. This experience sharpened my ability to think strategically about cybersecurity education and workforce development.

### 🎓 Academic Excellence & Practical Application

Graduating in **May 2025** with a **3.6 GPA** from Indiana Institute of Technology's rigorous Cybersecurity program, I've consistently balanced theoretical knowledge with practical application. My senior projects demonstrate this synthesis:

- **Penetration Testing Framework (Senior Project 2)**: Designed and executed comprehensive security assessments, identifying critical vulnerabilities and recommending remediation strategies based on industry standards.
- **Network Analysis with Wireshark (Senior Project 1)**: Performed deep packet inspection and traffic analysis to detect anomalies, intrusion attempts, and protocol vulnerabilities.

### 🚀 Innovation Through Automation

Beyond traditional security tools, I'm passionate about leveraging **emerging technologies** to enhance security operations. I recently created a **fully automated job application system** using **Claude Code** integrated with **Multi Context Protocol Tools (MCPs)** like BrowserMCP—demonstrating my ability to architect complex automation solutions that combine AI, browser automation, and workflow orchestration.

This project showcases my forward-thinking approach: using AI not just as a buzzword, but as a practical tool to solve real-world efficiency challenges while maintaining security and privacy standards.

### 🌟 Core Competencies

**Problem-Solving Under Pressure**: Whether it's responding to a security incident at Humata.AI or debugging a student's cryptography implementation at 10 PM before a project deadline, I thrive in high-pressure situations that demand rapid analysis, critical thinking, and decisive action.

**Attention to Detail**: In cybersecurity, the difference between a secure system and a compromised one often lies in the smallest oversight. My meticulous approach to log analysis, configuration reviews, and code audits has consistently uncovered vulnerabilities that automated tools missed.

**Collaborative Security Culture**: Security isn't a solo endeavor—it requires cross-functional collaboration. My experience working with development teams at Humata.AI, collaborating with professors on curriculum design, and guiding students through complex security concepts has honed my ability to build consensus and drive security initiatives across diverse stakeholder groups.
